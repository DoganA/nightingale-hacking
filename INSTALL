If you don't want to build Nightingale yourself, you can download
prebuilt binaries form http://getnightingale.com.

========================================================================
1. Prepare Build Envoironment:
========================================================================
Make sure you have all dependencies to build Nightingale installed and
added the wished configuration options. For further information, please
check out the README.

========================================================================
2. Build and Install Nightingale:
========================================================================

Type the following commands into any console with the context of the
source folder:

    $ ./build.sh
    $ sudo make install

If you are on Windows or Mac OS X, the `sudo make install` command will
not work. You will find an installed in the compiled/dist folder.

========================================================================
A. On Updating
========================================================================

By installing Nightingale to your system, Nightingale can no longer
update itself. This is most likely deserved, as updates would replace
self-built binaries with pre-built binaries. You will still receive a
notification if an update is available, but applying it will fail.

In order to update your Nightingale installation, you will have to
redownload the source code of Nightingale, build and install it again.

If you want automatic updates, adjust the INSTALL_LIBDIR variable in the
Makefile to a location in your homefolder.
