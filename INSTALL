If you don't want to build Nightingale yourself, you can Download
prebuilt binaries form http://getnightingale.com.

========================================================================
1. Prepare Build Envoironment:
========================================================================
Make sure you have all dependencies for Nightingale installed and added
the wished configuration options. For further Information, please check
out the README.

========================================================================
2. Build and Install Nightingale:
========================================================================

Type the following commands into any console with the context of the
source folder:

    $ ./build.sh
    $ sudo make install

If you are on Windows or Mac OS X, the `sudo make install` command will
not work. You will find an installed in the compiled/dist folder.

========================================================================
A. On Updating
========================================================================

By installing Nightingale to your systm, Nightingale can no longer
update itself. This is most likely deserved, as updates would replace
self-built binaries with pre-built binaries. You will still receiver a
notification if an update is available, but applying it will fail.

You will have to redownload the source code of Nightingale, build and
install it again.

If you want automatic updates, don't run `sudo make install` and instead
use Nightingale from your homefolder.
